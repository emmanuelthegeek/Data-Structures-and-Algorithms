LINKED LISTS

A linked list is a collection of nodes. It is a type of data structure. 

A node is an element in a linked list.

A node is divided into two namely:
	1. Data (also known as VALUE).
	2. Pointer/Next (also known as the reference to the next data/value)

The first node is referred to as the HEAD, and serves as the beginning point for any iteration through the array.

The last node must have its reference pointing to NONE, to indicate the end of the linked list.
